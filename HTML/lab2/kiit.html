                    KIIT was established in 1992 as a vocational training centre with only two staff and 12
                    students. However,
                    it took shape as an institution only in 1997, when degree engineering programme commenced.
                    KIIT owes its existence to the vision of its founder Prof.
                    Achyuta Samanta who, with no land, limited finances (only Rs. 5000/-) and little knowledge of
                    higher education
                    to create an institution for the benefit of the society. From these small beginnings,
                    KIIT has developed into a leading university with a strong interdisciplinary culture
                    and a commitment to teaching excellence.
