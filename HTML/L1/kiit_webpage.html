      KIIT was established in 1992 as a vocational training centre with only two staff and 12 students. However,
      it took shape as an institution only in 1997, when degree engineering programme commenced.
      KIIT owes its existence to the vision of its founder Prof.
      Achyuta Samanta who, with no land, limited finances (only Rs. 5000/-) and little knowledge of higher education
      to create an institution for the benefit of the society. From these small beginnings,
      KIIT has developed into a leading university with a strong interdisciplinary culture
      and a commitment to teaching excellence.

        <h3>Scholarship</h3>
        The Institute also grants scholarships to meritorious and needy students every year.
        Among them, Pradyumna Bal Memorial Scholarship is awarded to two economically challenged but
        meritorious students and they are provided completely free education along with ancillary expenses.
